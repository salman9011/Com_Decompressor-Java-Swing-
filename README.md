# Com_Decompressor-Java-Swing-
 This is the initial commit of Data compression and Decompression implemented using Java Swing's JFrame in Eclipse. The  aims to provide an user friendly interface and any one can use it on their Desktop.
 # Features
 Data Compression: Compress data files using the Gz (gzip) algorithm, reducing file sizes efficiently.
 Data Decompression: Decompress previously compressed data back to its original form.
 User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive graphical interface built with Java Swing for easy interaction and file selection.
 High Compression Ratio: Achieve effective compression ratios with the Gz (gzip) algorithm for various data types.
 Error Handling: Robust error handling provides user-friendly feedback during compression and decompression operations.
 Easy Installation: Simple installation process allows users to quickly set up and utilize the application for data compression needs.
