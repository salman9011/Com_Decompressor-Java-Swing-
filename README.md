# Com_Decompressor-Java-Swing-
 This is the initial commit of Data compression and Decompression implemented using Java Swing's JFrame in Eclipse. The  aims is  to provide an user friendly interface and any one can use it on their Desktops.
 # Features
 Data Compression: Compress data files using the Gz (gzip) algorithm, reducing file sizes efficiently.
 Data Decompression: Decompress previously compressed data back to its original form.
 User-Friendly GUI: Intuitive graphical interface built with Java Swing for easy interaction and file selection.
 High Compression Ratio: Achieve effective compression ratios with the Gz (gzip) algorithm for various data types.
 Error Handling: Robust error handling provides user-friendly feedback during compression and decompression operations.
 Easy Installation: Simple installation process allows users to quickly set up and utilize the application for data compression needs.
 
 # Installation
 Ensure you have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your system. If not, download and install the latest JRE from the official Oracle website or adopt OpenJDK. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command: git clone - Open Eclipse IDE (or any other Java IDE that supports Swing development). In Eclipse, click on File -> Open Project, and then select the Dcom and decom directory you cloned in Step 2. Build the project by clicking on Run -> Build Project.
 
 # Usage
 After building the project, click on Run -> Run Project to launch the data compression and decompression. The project will open in a new window, and you can start using it by selecting the file for compression. Use the mouse to click on a compress button to select file, after selecting file click on Ok it will automatically compress file with gzip format in the same directory where original file is located. If you want to decompress file back to original click on decompress button select compressed file and click on ok it will automatically decompress file back to original and there is not data loss. The project may implement additional features like compress all types of files  and some other formats of compressed file and adding passcode on compressed files etc.
  # Steps to Compile with some SS
  
 1.This is my Project design template.

2.After compailing this is the 1st state of our project. here we can see one window and inside it we have to buttons for performing  selecting specific files ,you can also change the size of window.![Screenshot (210)](https://github.com/salman9011/Com_Decompressor-Java-Swing-/assets/70580281/2546e7ff-74e7-4236-bfcf-9ad6795e031d)
3. When you click on Select button  for compressing you can see another popup for selecting file in particular destination and when you click on save it will automatically compress file.

4.When you click on Select button for decompressing you can see another popup through which you can go to that particulat destination and select the compressed file and cdecompress it again.![Screenshot (211)](https://github.com/salman9011/Com_Decompressor-Java-Swing-/assets/70580281/54f632fb-48a3-46e5-8f33-acf3a18c512d)
5. The Desktop application is also available you can see it in release seection.
you can directly download exe file from hereüëáüëáüëá
https://github.com/salman9011/Com_Decompressor-Java-Swing-/releases/tag/v1.0.0

#Enjoy and use exe file to save more space in your Desktops.
Have fun in using the application Save youur Space for Future use and make your files little more secure.

Remember to refer to the README file in the repository for any specific instructions or additional details about the Application

Please note that the actual process and appearance may vary depending on the specific implementation of the compression and decompression application and the programming language used. The screenshots provided here are for illustrative purposes, and the filenames and commands are examples that should be adjusted based on your specific project.
